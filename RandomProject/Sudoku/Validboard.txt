Run a simulation of the board program to simulate different valid boards
This process will take time because different variations of boards will come up and most of them ...
will be invalid boards.
If a board is invalid (which will be about 99% of the case) ignore that and simulate another board
If however the board is valid meaning that for every abritrary cell in the board is a unique number
in it's respective row column and square, the board should be saved somehow.
