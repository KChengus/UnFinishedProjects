Find the biggest square of 1:s in a matrix

A square of 1:s in a matrix is defined as 1:s in a square formation
both around the square and inside it.

The following is considered a grid:

0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 
ans = 2

0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
ans = 1

Testcase:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
ans = 4

potential solution
loop through row after row
check for sequences of ones.
if a sequence of ones are found
loop through the rows below by the number of ones identified. 
if the ones below also have the same sequence of ones at the 
same position or more then continue
if all the rows are complete then add that to the highest number
of square. If not then continue
